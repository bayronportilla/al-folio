This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/){:target="\_blank"} engine. You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.
